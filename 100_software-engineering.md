# Software Engineering

## Engineering

The work of *producing* an idea of how to create something is called
"Engineering".

## Different Ideas

### Structured Programming

#### Advantage

TODO

#### Examples

TODO

#### Structures

##### Sequence

Run one instruction after another.

##### Selection

Run instructions `if` some condition is fulfilled.

##### Iteration

Run the same set of instructions over and over.
In most cases the count of iterations is limited by a condition similar to the
condition of a [Selection][].

### Modular Design

#### Advantage

Something which is modularly built exposes so called "interfaces" which can be
used by other components.

The built components can be reused in several places which eases fixing bugs and
minimizes error prone repetition.

#### Examples

Cars can have many different tires which all have the same "interface" so the
car producers do not need to build the tires for their cars on their own.
